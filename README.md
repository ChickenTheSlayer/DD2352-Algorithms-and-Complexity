DD2352 Algorithms and Complexity
Course contents
Principles of algorithm design:  Divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. Algorithm analysis. Probabilistic algorithms. Approximation algorithms. Selected applications in sets, graphs, arithmetic and geometry. Implementation of algorithms.

Computability and complexity:  Reductions. The complexity classes P (polynomial time), NP (non-deterministic polynomial time), PSPACE (polynomial space) and BPP (probabilistic polynomial time with bounded error). NP completeness and NP hardness reductions. Undecidable problems.

Intended Learning Outcomes
After passing the course, the student should be able to

develop and implement algorithms and reductions, and analyse them with respect to correctness and efficiency
compare alternative algorithms considering efficiency
define and explain central concepts such as P, NP, NP-completeness and undecidability
compare problems with respect to complexity by means of reductions
in order to

independently be able to design computer programs that use time and memory efficiently and thereby can contribute to economically and environmentally sustainable development
in professional life identify problems that are unrealistically resource demanding or not possible to solve on a computer.
